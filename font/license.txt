TrueType core fonts for the Web FAQ (Excerpt)

Q What can I do with these fonts?
A For all the rules that govern the use of these fonts please read the end user license agreement.

Anyone can download and install these fonts for their own use.
Designers can specify the fonts within their Web pages. Our guide to specifying fonts in Web pages explains how to do this.
You may only redistribute the fonts in their original form (.exe or .sit.hqx) and with their original file name from your Web site or intranet site.
You must not supply the fonts, or any derivative fonts based on them, in any form that adds value to commercial products, such as CD-ROM or disk based multimedia programs, application software or utilities. See Microsoft's permissions site for more details.
