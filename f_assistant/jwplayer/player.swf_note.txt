Constructing the Video String

Coming up with a usable og:video tag is a bit of a challenge. Since many of our plugins require similar configuration, we've got some documentation that should come in handy. However, you can also follow these steps to build the string:

Start with the absolute path to your JW Player (ie, "http://www.example.com/jwplayer/player.swf").
Next, add a "?". Everything after this will be interpreted as player configuration, and ensures that your web server will serve up your video player.
For each configuration option you'd like to specify, add the name of the configuration option, then a "=", and finally the URL-encoded version of the value you wish to specify (ie "file=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2Fbunny.flv&autostart=true"). Be sure to separate each configuration option with a "&".
As always, you'll need to make sure that you're using absolute paths to reference your content and skins. Also, you'll need to make sure that you have the proper cross-domain security restrictions in place.

Configuration Options

There are three options for configuring which media file(s) to load in the player:

file
URL to a single MP4/FLV/WebM video, AAC/MP3/Vorbis audio, YouTube page or HLS/RTMP stream to play. See Supported Media Formats for an overview.
image
URL to a JPG/PNG poster image to display before playback is started. For audio-only media, the poster image stays visible during playback.
title
Title of the media loaded in the player. Is displayed in the middle of the display before playback is started.
Note these options are used only for basic setups, like playing a single MP4 video or AAC song. Use the playlist option block for everything else, like an MP4+WebM source, SD+HD quality or a list with multiple clips. See Working with Playlists for more info.
